# Elastic collisions

In an elastic collision, the kinetic energy and momentum are conserved.

This small fragment in Javascript simulates a system of balls of different sizes and masses.

The parameters (number and size of the balls, elasticity of the collisions, etc.) can easily be changed in the code.
